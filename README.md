## Usage

Once the Summarizer plugin is installed and configured, it will automatically detect article links in Discord messages. When a message contains a link, you will see a "âœ¨ Summarize" button in the message context menu (right-click on the message).

Click on the "âœ¨ Summarize" button to generate a summary of the linked article. The summary will be appended to the original message, formatted as follows:

```
## ðŸ“° Article Summary
**ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights**
1. Google is rolling out an AI-powered search feature that provides summarized answers instead of links.
2. Users are finding instances where the AI generates inaccurate or even dangerous information.
3. Google acknowledges the issue but claims the problem is isolated to uncommon queries and that most users are receiving accurate information.
4. There are concerns that these inaccurate answers could erode public trust in Google's search engine.
**ðŸ“Œ Main Topic(s)**
- Google's new AI-powered search feature
- Accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content
- Potential impact on Google's brand and search engine dominance
**ðŸ’¡ Takeaway**
Google's attempt to incorporate AI into its search engine is facing challenges due to the risk of inaccurate and potentially harmful information. While the company claims the issue is limited, the article highlights the potential for this to significantly damage Google's reputation and user trust.
